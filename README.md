# Claude Code Web UI

A lightweight web-based companion for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). The backend is just a Claude Code interactive session running in tmux — no custom AI server, no API keys, no proxy. Any tool, MCP server, or slash command available in Claude Code works here too. Access it via SSH port forwarding or bind to a custom host/port.

## Why This Exists

Claude Code is a powerful CLI tool, but sometimes you want a browser-based interface — for remote access, diff review, or just a more visual experience. This project wraps Claude Code with a thin web layer:

- **Zero overhead** — No separate AI backend. Claude Code IS the backend. The server just bridges tmux I/O to a WebSocket.
- **Full compatibility** — Every tool, skill, and command in Claude Code works unchanged. The web UI is a viewer and input relay, not a reimplementation.
- **Resilient** — Claude runs in tmux. Close the browser, lose your network, reconnect from another device — Claude keeps working. The UI catches up with a summary of what happened while you were away.

## Features

- **Chat UI** — Claude.ai-style chat with markdown rendering, user/assistant bubbles
- **Diff Review** — VS Code-style Monaco diff viewer for Edit/Write tool calls (click to expand)
- **Streaming Output** — live preview card while Claude is responding (via tmux capture)
- **Session Management** — switch between sessions, history persisted per-session alongside Claude's JSONL
- **Command Autocomplete** — type `/` for slash commands with sub-options (`/model`, `/effort`, `/permission-mode`)
- **File Explorer** — persistent sidebar with lazy directory loading, resizable width
- **File Autocomplete** — type `@` for file path suggestions resolved against Claude's CWD
- **Shell Commands** — type `!command` to run shell commands directly from the input box
- **`/btw` Support** — side questions shown as floating toast popups
- **Permission Control** — approve/deny tool calls from the browser
- **Reconnection** — survives network drops, browser closes, and device switches. Claude keeps running in tmux; the UI reconnects and shows a summary of missed events (edits, commands, agent activity)
- **Token Auth** — random access token generated each start, cookie-based session, `--no-auth` to disable
- **Light/Dark Theme** — toggle via sun/moon button in header
- **Status Bar** — shows model, permission mode, effort level, CWD, connection status

## How It Works

```
Browser (localhost:3001)
    |  WebSocket
    v
Node.js Server
    |  hooks via --settings
    v
Claude Code (in tmux)
```

The server manages a Claude Code process inside a tmux session. Claude Code hooks stream events (tool calls, messages, permissions) to the server via HTTP. The server stores events in a per-session SQLite database and broadcasts to the browser via WebSocket. User input goes from the browser through `tmux send-keys` to Claude.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **tmux** installed
- **Claude Code** installed and authenticated (`claude` command works)
- **jq** (for the permission hook script)

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-liner: clone + install + build + start
git clone https://github.com/mxinO/Claude-Web-UI.git && cd Claude-Web-UI && ./start.sh

# With a specific working directory
./start.sh /path/to/project

# Custom host and port
./start.sh --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9999

# Combine options
./start.sh --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 /path/to/project
```

The server prints a URL with an access token to the console — click or copy-paste it to authenticate:

```
Open in browser: http://localhost:3001?token=abc123...
  Access token: abc123...
```

For remote access, use SSH port forwarding: `ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 your-server`

The `start.sh` script auto-detects first run and handles `npm install` + build. Subsequent starts are instant.

### Other ways to start

```bash
# Using npm directly
npm start                                          # default: localhost:3001
npm start -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9999            # custom host/port
npm start -- --no-auth                              # disable authentication
npm start -- /path/to/project                       # specific CWD
npm run start:mock                                  # mock mode (no Claude, for UI testing)
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3001` | Server port (overridden by `--port`) |
| `HOST` | `localhost` | Server bind address (overridden by `--host`) |
| `CLAUDE_TMUX_SESSION` | `claude` | tmux session name |
| `CLAUDE_TMUX_PANE` | `0` | tmux pane index |
| `MAX_EVENT_AGE_DAYS` | `30` | Auto-prune events older than this |

## Usage

### Chat
Type messages in the input box. Enter sends, Shift+Enter for newline.

### Slash Commands
Type `/` to see available commands. Select one and type arguments:
- `/model opus` — switch model
- `/effort high` — set effort level
- `/plan` — toggle plan mode
- `/btw <question>` — ask a side question without interrupting
- `/compact` — compact conversation context

### Shell Commands
Type `!` followed by a command to run it directly on the server in Claude's working directory:
- `!ls` — list files
- `!git status` — check git status
- `!cat file.txt` — view file contents

Output appears as a styled card in the chat. Interactive commands (`vim`, `less`, `python`, etc.) are blocked. 30-second timeout.

### File References
Type `@` to autocomplete file paths. The sidebar file explorer (toggle with the arrow button) lets you browse directories and insert paths with the `+` button.

### Session Switching
Click the session ID in the header bar to see recent sessions. Click one to switch — Claude restarts with `--resume` in the correct working directory.

### Diff Review
Click any Edit/Write tool card in the chat to open a Monaco diff viewer. Click "View full file" to load the complete file on demand.

### Theme
Click the sun/moon icon in the header to toggle light/dark theme.

```

### Per-Session Database

Each session's events are stored in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session-id>.webui.db` alongside Claude's JSONL transcript. When Claude deletes old sessions, the web UI database goes with it. When switching to a session without a webui.db, history is imported from the JSONL transcript.

### Hooks

Hooks are configured in a local `data/hooks-settings.json` file and passed to Claude via `--settings`. They are **not** installed globally — other Claude sessions (CLI, VS Code) are unaffected.

## Development

```bash
# Run server + Vite dev server with HMR
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build frontend only
npm run build
```

## Security Warning

This is a **personal development tool**, not a production service. Be aware of:

- **Network exposure** — The server binds to `localhost` by default (safe for SSH port forwarding). If you use `--host 0.0.0.0`, the server is accessible on the network but protected by a random access token (generated each start, printed to console). Use `--no-auth` to disable authentication if not needed.
- **Token authentication** — Auth uses a random token set as an httpOnly cookie. The token changes every server restart. Hook endpoints are restricted to localhost. This is lightweight protection for a dev tool, not a production auth system.
- **Permission approval** — The permission control UI (approve/deny tool calls) works but has **not been extensively tested** across all Claude Code versions and edge cases. Treat it as a convenience, not a security boundary. When running with elevated permission modes (`auto`, `bypassPermissions`), Claude acts without asking.
- **Shell execution** — The `!command` feature runs commands directly on the host as the server's user. Interactive commands are blocked by a best-effort blocklist, and there is a 30-second timeout, but this is not a sandbox.
- **File access** — The file explorer and `@` autocomplete only block a small set of sensitive dotfiles (`.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.env`). All other files readable by the server process are accessible.

## Known Limitations

- **Slash commands** — The autocomplete list is hardcoded and may not include all commands available in your Claude Code version. Commands not in the list still work when typed manually.
- **Permission hooks** — Permission approval/denial is routed through hooks. If Claude Code changes its hook format, the integration may break silently.
- **Single user** — The server manages one Claude tmux session. Multiple browser tabs work (shared WebSocket), but multiple simultaneous users may conflict.
- **Shell commands** — `!command` runs one command at a time. Interactive programs (`vim`, `less`, `python`, etc.) are blocked. Commands that spawn background children (`cmd &`) are not tracked after the parent exits. The blocklist can be bypassed via indirect invocation (e.g., `bash -c "vim"`); the 30-second timeout is the real safety net.
- **Session resume** — When switching sessions, the CWD is restored from the session database. If the original directory no longer exists, Claude starts in the server's CWD.
- **Streaming output** — Live preview is captured via `tmux capture-pane` polling. Very fast output may be partially missed in the preview (the final result is always captured by hooks).
- **Diff viewer** — Only shows diffs for Edit/Write tool calls. Multi-file edits (MultiEdit) show each file separately.

## Tech Stack

- **Server:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, better-sqlite3, ws
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **Diff Viewer:** Monaco Editor (lazy-loaded)
- **Markdown:** react-markdown + remark-gfm + rehype-highlight
